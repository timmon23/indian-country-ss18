		 <p>Police Brutality has been affecting the lives of many minority groups, Including Native Americans. 
		 When considering Police Brutality and it's affects on Native Americans as a whole Barbara Perry (2010)
		 has explored the ideas of where ethno-violence stems from, which will be introduced in the next few paragraphs. 
		 Ethno-violence is the idea that distinguishes unwarranted hostile acts against people for their race, religion, 
		 ethnicity, etc. A closely related term is considered to be "Hate Crimes". South Dakotas Yankton Sioux Tribe is all 
		 too familiar with ethno-violence and hate crimes from police officers.</p>

		 <h3>The Underlying Causes of Police Brutality</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Ethno-violence has been dated back to the beginning of colonization. Barbara Perry (2010) believes that police brutality
		 and many other contemporary issues Native Americans face today stems from social oppression. She believes that "It is systematic 
		 and structural in nature reflecting a network of norms, assumptions, behaviors, and policies which are connected in such a way as to 
		 reproduce the racialized and gendered hierarchies which characterize the society in question.". Young (1990) came up with five inter-related 
		 "faces of oppression" in which we might characterize the experiences of minority groups: Exploitation, Marginalization, Powerlessness, Cultural 
		 Imperialism, and Violence. Barbara Perry (2010) states that structural exclusion caused by social oppression leaves minority members vulnerable
		 to systemic violence which may run the gamut from ethnocide to ethno-violence.</p>

		 <h3>DAPL</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>What began as innocent protests turned into a nightmare for Native Americans fighting for clean water. DAPL is a 3.7 billion project 
		 that would transport oil, under ground, from North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago, Illinois. This pipeline would run through Standing Rock 
		 Sioux Tribes only access to clean water. When this pipeline was first introduced to The White House Barack Obama declined it, but after Donald Trump 
		 was elected he passed the bill to start building the pipeline. Protesters against DAPL worry that the pipeline will contaminate their only access 
		 to clean water from the Mississippi River and could potentially ruin Standing Rocks sacred native land. Activists against the pipeline have shown
		 numerous times that they have been peaceful and unarmed while protesting, but that still hasn’t stopped the police from mistreating and abusing the 
		 people fighting for their right to clean water.The earliest formalized police bodies in North America were constituted as slave patrols, with the 
		 legitimate authority to seek and apprehend escaped slaves as a means of maintaining their servitude (Bass 2001; Greene, 2003). Even in the 
		 beginning of forming police bodies we can see that the underlying cause stems from racism.</p>

		 <h3>How the Sioux Tribe is Responding</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The Sioux Tribe and many others are still fighting for their right to clean water. The Sioux tribe continues to protest in the only way they
		 believe is right; Unarmed and peaceful, even when the police officers continuously harass the protesters using military methods of tear gassing 
		 them and spraying them with water the temperature of below freezing. Many of the Natives in South Dakotas Standing Rock Yankton Tribe participate
		 in rally's and marches fighting for their lives and protection from police officers using the phrase #NativeLivesMatter.</p>
		 
		 <br>
		 <h3>How Police Brutality is affecting Natives</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Police brutality has affected many aspects of Native lives, including higher death rates.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) collected data from 
		 1999 to 2015 and concluded that "for every one million Native Americans, an average of 2.9 of them are killed by law enforcement — the highest rate 
		 of any racial group in the U.S. Natives also have a mortality rate 12 percent higher than African Americans and three times higher than white Americans."
		 (Center for Disease Control). Higher death rates arent the only issues caused by police brutality. Some issues Natives face due to police brutality 
		 include higher rates of PTSD and higher rates of poverty. However, The affects of police brutality isn't all bad. "The activism which has been at the 
		 root of so much violence and the backlash associated with it, has engendered a renewed pride in American Indian identity. With this has come a recognition
		 of the need to pursue what is theirs by right. In short, it has mobilized Native Americans around their cultural identity and political sovereignty." (Barbara Perry, 2010).</p>
