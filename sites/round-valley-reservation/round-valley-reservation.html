      <h1>Round Valley Reservation, Education, and the Sherman Institute</h1>
      <h3>1920s- Current Day </h3>
	  <h4>TRAVERSE COTTRELL</h4>
	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  	<p>The evolution of education on the Round Valley Reservation has been great. Since the early 1900s, 
	  	they have been under similar regiment of the boarding school as other Nations have, across the United
	  	States. Over time, and through changes in United States legislation, they have been able to 
	  	evolve their schooling over time to reflect more of the Nations' interests on the reservation.
	  	In contemporary education stances, it has become much more diverse, as the old Sherman Institute has 
	  	gone through drastic changes from being a government regimented institute to one of the most
	  	sought after native boarding schools offered to Indigenous peoples. At the same time, after the Round Valley school
	  	system was created, it has been heavily ridiculed for not meeting education standards under the No Child Left Behind 
	  	Act. Outside of the school system, Round Valley has the Head Start program, which is designed to get 
	  	children more family oriented, and to develop their sense of mind, along with the rest of their family. </p>
         <h2>Early 1900s Sherman Indian Institute</h2>
         <p>During the early 1900s, boarding schools were implemented across the United States
          in an attempt to educate the native population of western ideologies. Because public
          schools were ill-advised for natives, due to the extreme Californian racism among the
          white parents, agents nd superintendents "recognized that Sherman was one of the few places 
          Round Valley Indian children could continue their education." (Bauer 404)</p>

</figure> 
          <p>In 1903, the Sherman Institute was created, off reservation, with four dormitories available to live in, 
          offering Western education for grades 9-12. During the students' stay, they would be segregated
          by gender, taught different curriculum, and were given negative reinforcement towards white superiority
          (The Students of Sherman Indian School 50). The curriculum that the students were given 
          was unlike any teaching that they have encountered before, as gendered tasks were not as 
          clear as a mark of native society. "Reservation agents and school superintendents believed 
          that a proper Victorian home life, with sexual purity before marriage, monogamous and life-long
          marriages, and separate economic gender spheres, was central to the goal of assimilating Round
          Valley Indians.</p>
          <p>In regards to the particular curriculum their students learned, females were assigned 
          duties such as creaming vegetables, practicing good table service, and personal habits in the
          kitchen and dining room (Bauer 409). These activities were described as "the cult of true womanhood,"
          with the ideal woman showing "purity, piety, selflessness, domesticity, obedience, and meekness."
          Males were taught the types and breeds of dairy cattle, shown how to care for the cows and
          their milk, and explained how to increase the size of ones herd. They would be put under 
          long hours of strenuous labor to educate them on farming, stock raising, plant production, and 
          for beautifying home grounds. (Bauer 410)</p>
       <h2>Mid 30s to Early 50s</h2>
       	<p>As the government made moves towards self-determination, similarly did the students of 
       	Sherman Institute. In 1938, the students formed a student council, and it soon developed into an 
       	Intertribal Reform (Bahr 44). The push towards self-determination started to shift the 
       	environment towards a more hospitable school, but as this progressed, World War II began.
       	For a long period beginning in 1948, Sherman shifted its mode of operation, of where they 
       	no longer enrolled students, was effectively shut down, and began teaching and building aircrafts
       	to assist in the war (Bahr 48).</p>
       	<p>From the point of where Sherman Institute became militarized in its education, it adopted 
       	much of the militaristic jargon, of where the Navajo program began to educate Indians 
       	for 6 months of negative reinforcement of white superiority (Bahr 50). If students did not wish to participate
       	in this program after joining, they would be considered a 'deserter,' which shows "evidence of
       	the persistence of the military structure, despite the goal of the [IRA] to eliminate the 
       	military regimentation (Bahr 54).</p>
       	<h2>Mid 50s to Early 70s</h2>
       	<p> The shift from militarization and assimilation to self-determination began to shape
       	the Sherman Institute again. Senator Robert Kennedy released a statement regarding Native education,
       	saying that "The Indians were promised an adequate education, but those treaties have been 
       	broken...We pledge ourselves to make efforts for improvement at this Institute and in Indian
       	schools across the country" (Bahr 79). This then triggered a comprehensive investigation of 
       	education among Natives across the nation.</p>
       	<p> Elwin Svenson, a reporter for the government regarding Native education, found a total of
       	10 inadequacies with the Sherman Institute, including inadequate staff, funding, admissions
       	criteria, student interest, and administrative skill in budgeting (Bahr 81). Promptly after this,
       	at the North Fork conference, the ad hoc committee stressed the need for Indian involvement
       	in their own education process, and the value of Native heritage (Bahr 84). In fact, they
       	eventually evolved into the California Indian Education Association (CIEA), of where they expressed
       	their concerns to Sherman, "with these specific recommendations: an all-Indian board of
       	directors, a program that reflected California Indian enrollment, curricula that expressed 
       	Indian concepts, a lower student-teacher ratio, and accommodations for visiting parents (Bahr 84).
       	On January 7th, 1967, for the first time since 1948, California Indians would be enrolled at the Sherman Institute, 
       	under new management. A new age of education dawned for many Californian Indians.</p>
       	<hr>
       	<h2>Mid 70s to the 21st Century</h2>
       	<p>In 1972, the Endian Education Act passed, which allowed Indians to determine their 
       	own curriculum (Bahr 91). There was an amazing positive reform for Native education, such as 
       	driver education classes, and physical education Ibid. This new policy was completely 
       	evident in the Sherman arts and crafts program. The Institute brought in tribal craftsmen 
       	from major tribes, to teach their own specialties (Bahr 92). Students were so engaged with 
       	this program that they no longer wanted to leave the classroom. A decade later, the Native American
       	Languages Act of 1990 passed, which moved to preserve Native languages, and to help promote
       	the education of them again to prevent the loss of their language (Bahr 99). In addition, this 
       	allowed Native American languages to be the main language they use in schools, which allowed
       	education to move towards a more traditional and preservation stance Ibid.  </p>
       	<h3>Sherman Indian High School</h3>
       	<p>The Sherman Indian High School is the reimagined Sherman Institute, and although it is
       	still a boarding school, it is completely dedicated towards native education and development.
       	 Being a high school, grades 9-12, it offers the standards of being in a public high school, while 
       	 still educating the students on many of the cultural and tribal engagements of their heritage. 
       	 Currently, this boarding school is one of the best opportunities to allow students to graduate 
       	  while demonstrating "the knowledge and ability to live in two worlds," (Sherman 7). This school
       	  is one of the more highly sought after schools, eligible to native students only.</p>

       	<h3>Round Valley Unified School District</h3>
       	<p>The Round Valley Unified School District, (RVUSD), serves as a school system that serves students
       	in the Round Valley Tribal Community, along with the surrounding rural areas. Although this 
       	school system is one of the most culturally and geographically isolated in california, 76% of the school age children are American Indian.
       	Unfortunately, because poverty is so pervasive in this area, 100% of the students in this system
       	can qualify for free student lunches and breakfasts through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). (LEAP 9)
       	In the same sense, due to the impoverished conditions that this district holds, there is 
       	also a large turnover rate for staff, which can challenge their standardized goals, and 
       	thusly put the school system under state observation. (LEAP 11)</p>
       	<h4>Round Valley Elementary School</h4>
       	<p>In the year 2000, the Round Valley Elementary school participated in the Immediate intervention/ Underperforming Schools
       	Program, as their standards for education did not fit the standardized federal aid program.
       	Due to this, the school became a state-monitored school(LEAP 8). Since then, their Academic Performance Growth
       	has increased gradually from 2006-2010, of which they have exceeded standardized growth curves 
       	to be removed from state sanction. </p>
       	<h4>Round Valley High School</h4>
       	<p>This high school has been under stress recently, due to the overwhelmingly large amount of 
       	staff turnover rate (~35%) (LEAP 12). In addition to this, the attendance rate has been dropping since 
       	2004-2005, and the overall enrolled students have also been steadily declining. This decline has been steady until
       	the year 2010. They have been emphasizing a new instructional system that used benchmark assessments, pacing guides, and
       	classroom strategies to help improve the achievements of the students. They recently went under program 
       	renovations, renovating their classroom system for education, as it has been lacking up until 2010 (LEAP 13).
       	As of now, their faculty has been changed to meet a higher education standard, and the classrooms
       	are meeting standard marks for public education, without very much emphasis on culture or language. </p>

	<figcaption>Image 3 - Round Valley High School Gymnasium</figcaption>
</figure> 
       	<h5>Drop Outs/Graduation Rates/Faculty Attendance</h5>
       	<p>For the standard four year program, the student drop out rate in the high school is a staggering
       	57.4%, of which compared to the state dropout rate, is 18.9% (LEAP 11). This amount is staggering, partially
       	because not only do the students not come to class, but the teachers as well. In total, approximately 
       	3000 hours have been lost due to poor attendance by the employees (LEAP 20). When teachers are not able
       	to attend their classes, many times substitutes are not used, reducing the total amount of time 
       	education can even be taught. This could be due to in part of the lack of a professional development
       	 plan, as although there are courses for elementary and middle school teachers, there is no 
       	 course work in place for high school teachers, crippling their ability to educate well.</p>

       	<h3>The Head Start Program</h3>
       	<p>As part of the Round Valley Reservation's programs to foster child development, they have 
       	created the "Head Start" program, which is designed for child development from ages 3 to 5, 
       	along with their families, and expecting women (RVIT). Coursework for this program involves
       	building foundational skills, such as individuality and identity, supporting individual heritage, 
       	bringing in many cultural aspects of the tribes on the Round Valley, and fostering a 
       	multilingual environment (RVIT). The goals that this program has in place is to build strong family
       	connections, developing interactions on the social, cognitive, physical, and emotional level (RVTIO)
       	As it is traditionally expected, they teach that the parents are one of the most important teachers
       	for children, and that all learning is done in the aspect of family, as that is the primary 
       	form of development children will grow up under. </p>
