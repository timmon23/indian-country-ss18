     <h3>Introduction To The Region</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		   <p>The fire season, generally, begins at the end of spring and persists into the fall. On some occasions, however, the fires will persist until the first snow fall of the season. The northwest includes states such as Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, and Montana, but other states, such as California, Colorado, and (occasionally) Arizona, also suffer from frequent wildfires. Due to these fires, Indigenous communities may suffer from loss of economical income, their livelihoods, their homes, family members, livestock, sites that are sacred, health deterioration, and many other factors. Some of the most detrimental fires in recent years to federally recognized tribes includes the North Star Fire (WA), the Spokane Fire (WA), and the Nez Perce Fires (ID). </p>

     <h3>Brief History of Major Wildfires</h3>
      <hr>
        <p>The most widely known fire to cause the most destruction in this region would be the 1910 fires, or the Great Fire of 1910. This fire season began in the Blackfeet National Forest in the northwestern portion of Montana on April 29th, 1910. Fires continued throughout the next several months, and by august the region was experiencing drought like conditions. The increasing amounts of fires was largely due to railroads and lack of funding, supplies, and manpower to combat the fires. On August 10th, "fires had broken out and were quickly spreading on the surrounding Clearwater, Lolo, Cabinet, Flathead, Blackfeet, and Kaniksu National Forests. It was at this point that the National Forest Service persuaded President Howard Taft to deploy troops to replace the civilians, which amounted to approximately 4,000 troops being called into action. The troops and other federal resources were spread very thin to cover the entire Northwestern region. On August 20th, "hurricane-force winds swept through the region and fanned embers and low flames back to life throughout the Northern Rockies," which was later referred to as the Big Blowup (Forest History Society). People were evacuated by trains, because there was no stopping or containing the fire. Official reports have estimated that after the Big Blowup occurred, 1,736 fires burned more than 3 million acres of land and consumed an estimated 7.5 billion board feet of timber. Eighty-six individuals died during the Big Blowup, most of which were firefighters on the frontlines. The fire, overall, "affected forest fire fighting policy of the nation and influenced forest management to this very day" (US National Forest Service). This fire was also the first to receive mass amounts of media and public attention to wildfires and, the overall, forest health. It is unclear how greatly this fire affected the Indigenous populations, but it can be assumed that they were greatly impacted, along with other towns and cities in the northwest. </p>
        <p>Another significant fire includes the Yellowstone Fire, which is largely due to it occurring in a national park, as well as the amount of mass media it generated. The fire itself was not as large or as devastating as other fires, such as the Great Fire of 1910 or even, more recently, the North Star fire on the Colville Reservation. </p>

    <h3>Recent Fires and How it's Impacted Indigenous Peoples</h3>
      <hr>

      <p>Some of the more recent fires in the northwest region in the United States includes the North Star fire, the Spokane fire, and the Nez Perce fires, which all took place during the 2015 and 2016 fire seasons. The increased wildfires magnitude is largely due to the climate changes that have occurred, as well as the bark beetle population. The bark beetle is an invasive species in the northwestern region, including the Northern Rockies, that reproduce under the bark of trees and because it is an invasive species, it has no natural predators. These beetles often cause tree mortality and increase the amount of fuel that could be used if a wildfire were to breakout (Bark Beetles - US Forest Service Research & Development; Doyle et al. 2013; Loehman et al. 2018; Halofsky et al. 2018). There are two types of bark beetles that have largely impacted the forests within this region that include the pine beetle and spruce beetles. </p>

      <figure style= "float: left; width: 50%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

        </figure>




      <p> In recent years, much of the weather conditions that have allowed for the bark beetle populations to explode, as well as the deterioration of the forests' health, is the result of the lack of rainfall within the region (McNeel 2015a; Loehman et al. 2018; Halofsky et al. 2018). Other conditions that increase the magnitude of the flames is the wind and increasing temperatures, as well as lack of manpower and resources fighting the fires, and not enough fire prevention management methods prior to the fire season have taken place. This can also relate to the lack of funding put into the National Forest Services and local and state firefighting agencies.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Not many studies have been done on the health consequences to tribal members and the natural resources that they rely on a daily basis, with the exception of tribes located in Alaska and the southwestern portion of the U.S. (Doyle et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2016). Some of the health factors include the exposure to smoke, being directly impacted by the flames, and the rising yearly temperatures can impact the wildlife, such as fish, wild berries, and hunting game (Doyle et al. 2013; Loehman et al. 2018; McNeel 2015c). "There were days when the smoke was thick and heavy, but there are no measurements of air quality, so people concerned about the health risks had no way to assess the danger" (Doyle et al. 2013). On the Crow Reservation, located in Montana, it has been reported that "[t]he number of days exceeding 90 degree Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) has double in the past century" (Doyle Et al. 2013). Even cultural practices have been affected across the region, due to the potential threat of the wildfires and the increasing temperatures.</p>

          </figure>


      <p> The fires that will be examined here are those from 2015 and 2016, because much of the fires on tribal lands have not been fully studied or evaluated since then, as well as not much media attention has been given to the regional issue, with the exception of California. These fires include the Colville Fire, or the North Star Fires, that affected the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Spokane fire that affected the Spokane Tribe of Indians, and the Nez Perce Fires that affected the Nez Perce Tribe. The North Star Fires and the fires on the Spokane Reservation could be said to have gained the most media attention, as well as state and federal resources, due to the amount of damage caused by the fires. Each of the communities that have been affected and under direct threat from the flames had three levels of evacuation, with level three being the most critical and under the most hazardous conditions for the community. Level three entails actual evacuation from the site of imminent danger, level two is the preparation phase, such as gathering your possessions and organizing your family and pets, and the first level is a precautionary phase and the residents are not in any immediate danger (McNeel 2015a). It should, however, be remembered that "[t]he impact of wildfires lasts well beyond the time when the last ember is extinguished. Communities are affected, as are individuals and industries. Nearly every segment of tribal life is affected and some will continue to be for years to come" (McNeel 2015c).

        <p><strong> The North Star Fires,</strong> located on the Colville Reservation, began in early August, 2015, as the region suffered drought like conditions, dry and high temperatures (McNeel 2015a). These types of fires, such as the North Star Fires, often do not get put out until the first snowfall, when temperatures drop enough that containment can be made by the firefighters. Some of the reasoning, beyond the destruction, for why the fire was so devastating to the tribal community was that many of the tribal members relied on the lumber industry for their economical income (McNeel 2015c). It should be noted that by August 21st, 2015, President Barack Obama did declare an emergency for Washington State, due to the thousands of acres that were currently burning. This allowed access to federal funds for the counties affected by the fires, which included tribal lands (Staff 2015b).</p>

        <div style="clear:both"></div>
         <h4>North Star Fires Timeline:</h4>

         <ul>
          <li>August 22nd - The fire had consumed 126,522 acres with 0% containment with only 338 personnel battling the fire (Staff 2015b) </li>
          <li>August 25th- Over 150,000 acres, with, according to Tribal Charmain, Jim Boyd, at least one-eighth of the reservation was actively on fire. The town of Republic, located 15 miles north of the reservation was in stage two of evacuation, which in a preparation phase for evacuation (McNeal 2015a).</li>
          <li>August 27th- The fire has expanded from 155,000 acres to 168,539 acres in less than a day. The containment levels were at 5% with 648 firefighters fighting the blazes (McNeel 2015b). </li>
          <li>August 28th- 170,000 acres had been burned and consumed by the raging flames (McNeel 2015c).</li>
          <li>August 31st- The fire has expanded to 200,593 acres (McNeel 2015d)</li>
          <li>September 2nd- The fires have expanded by 205,000 acres, with only one-fourth the perimeter contained with 900 personnel fighting the blazes. The humidity levels have increased to 40-50 percent, which have helped in subduing the flames (McNeel 2015e).</li>
        </ul>

          <br>

          <p><strong>The Nez Perce Fires,</strong> located on and around the Nez Perce Reservation, is located in north central Idaho. Much of the same conditions as the North Star Fire were also affected in the other region's fires, such as the drought like conditions, as well as the not being put out until the first snowfall. However, the Nez Perce Fires were actively contained and proceeded into mop-up phase prior to end of the fire season.

            <h4>Nez Perce Fires Timeline:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>August 25th and prior- Fire had consumed 47,260 acres, damaging 117 structures, which included 47 homes. The baldy Point Fire threatened a sacred site to the tribe, called Baldy Point. At this point the tribe had requested that the Forest Service use suppression techniques to ensure the safety the of the cultural site (McNeel 2015a).</li>
            <li>August 27th- The fires have subsided and the tribe has reached 'mop-up' phase (McNeel 2015b).</li>
            <li>September 2nd- Mop-up operations have begun by this point. The overall estimated acreages burned was 82,956 acres (McNeel 2015e). </li>

            <br>

          <p><strong>The Spokane Fire </strong> was located on the Spokane Reservation, in Spokane, Washington. This fire, unlike the others, occurred in 2016 and consumed more than 159,000 acres.  Normally two bodies of water protect the tribe from the wildfires, but in this fire, it impacted the tribal community in several ways. The farmers and ranchers were "burned out- in one case, 15 head of cattle caught fire" (Briggs 2016).  The horses were fortunate to survive with burns, however, much of the wildlife, such as elk and deer, were also caught up in the flames and were not as fortunate. Due to the wind, consequently, the flames moved toward Wellpinit, which is the capital of the tribe. The community also had their water, phones, and water lines down. Most of the community had to rely on social media to keep their families updated on the situation. In total, 13 houses perished, along with many other outbuildings, barns, and vehicles. Escaping to the nearby city of Spokane was cutoff as the road, which is a "windy road on a steep hill," was closed due to the guardrails being destroyed (Briggs 2016). Even so, the tribe still put on their annual Labor Day Pow Wow, despite the situation they are given. Another rising concern, besides the main issue of the wildfires, was the combination of the fires with the potential impact of radiation. The Superfund Site at a historic uranium mine is of major concern to the tribal air quality director, because the firefighters are not normally trained or informed on how to fight fires on these types of radiation polluted sites, which could, "if disturbed by fire or firefighting could fill the air" (Briggs 2016).

    <h3>Fire Management and Adapting To Changing Climates</h3>
      <hr>
        <p>There are different levels for organizing fire management, which includes at the local, state, and federal levels. Federal policy has had two schools of thought when dealing with wildfires that either include actively managing the forests, such as through thinning forests and allowing for logging to occur, or to allow the fires to continue to burn. The ideology for the latter management strategy comes from the notion that wildfires are naturally occur and it is a way for the forest to replenish itself and allow for new growth (Loehman et al. 2018). Active mitigation efforts through prevention measures can include thinning of trees, fire suppression, and recovery tactics. One of the "core mission[s] of the National Park Service is the preservation, enhancement and interpretation of cultural resources" (Davis 2018).</p>
        <p>Majority of federally recognized tribes have recognized that wildfires are an annual issue and have their own organized fire crews that generally work on and off the reservation lands. For the past 40 years, firefighting has provided employment opportunities to Native Americans in organized fire crews. The National Forest Service Agency also has a Tribal Relations Office, which recruits tribal members into the Forest Service, while also encouraging Native Americans to attend Forestry and other natural resource management schools. </p>
