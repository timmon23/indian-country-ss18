		 <h5><font size="+2">An Introduction to Art and Cultural Identity</font></h5>
			<p>Art as a medium has historically been the most dynamic form of expression in humans.  Through these artistic forms we are able to express anything having to do with the human condition.  The framework in which this is presented is a vital way that we are able to communicate our identities to one another individually and as a group.  This page focuses on identity as it is presented in artistic performance, with a primary focus on the Anishinaabe communities of the Midwest and Canada.  Though there are many forms of artistic expression, this project has been focused on the three main forms as they are the most widely practiced throughout the Anishinaabe community: drum/singing performance, pictorial art, and dance performance.  Each form will be presented and defined in the three upcoming sections.  After each has been framed, I will present different meanings that are portrayed through these forms of art and how they relate to both the Anishinaabe and their fellow native Americans.</p>

		<h6><font size="+2">Drum and Singing Performance</font></h6>
			<p>Drums have held significance in Native American communities for as long as we’ve known about their existence.  Many tribes discuss how dances have been an integral part of their community for as long as they’ve inhabited their land.  As the drum and singing are two separate aspects of Anishinaabe artistic performance, I have decided to group them together due to their nature in performance.  The two are combined with one another in form in order to deliver the performance.</p>
			<br>
			<p>When discussing the drum, it is important to acknowledge the physicality of the instrument as well as how it is treated by the player.  Traditionally, ceremonial drums were made from raw materials surrounding the community’s place of living.  This carried the symbolism of Native Americans using what the Earth had provided them in order to praise it in the form of drumming and singing.  It is becoming more of a practice, recently, however that players will purchase pre-made drums for ceremonial use.  This has caused a rift, or what is described as a “loss of tradition” from the older members of the Anishinaabe community because of the commodification of the instrument (Vennum 14).  The symbolic nature of creating a drum unique to the performer is no longer present in the advent of this new commodification.  One can see how this practice would upset many of the members of the community that tend to lean towards holding their tradition exactly the way they grew up with it.  Overall, it affects the way that the performers maintain and care for the drum, as well, which is made different when the instrument is factory made instead of organically made.  Meaning is seemingly lost.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In addition to drumming, many of the performers sing, as well.  As elementary students in school, the young performers practice their drumming and singing once a week in addition to school.  As they grow older, into adolescence, their responsibilities grow to two or three times a week.  Sometimes they practice more if the prospective performers are more serious about their future duties.</p>
			<br>
			<p>These performers typically perform in groups that are formed at a very young age and travel from place to place performing at powwows and ceremonies for members of their community.  Each group has its own identity and therefore interprets their performance differently than other trained native performers.</p>
		
		<hr>
		<br>
		<h7><font size="+2">Dancing Performance</font></h7>
			<p>Often times accompanying the musical performance of drumming and singing is dancing.  Native American tradition is rich with dance expression and has used this form to celebrate their place in nature and connection to it.  Like song, this form of artistic expression has been relevant to the Anishinaabe and other native groups for thousands of years.  There are many dances that the Anishinaabe partake in, as well as the meanings carried by each dance.  I will describe a little bit of a history and practice of a dance used in Anishinaabe tradition to this day, The Grass Dance, as an example of the history of dancing performance in Anishinaabe tradition.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The origin of the Grass Dance, like most Anishinaabe and other native practices alike, is unknown.  However, it is known that the dance has been around throughout most of their historical tradition.  The principle idea of this dance is to represent respect for those who have paved the way for modern-day dancers to participate in the Grass Dance.  This is a tradition used in many Native American dances.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As an artistic movement, the structure of the dance is to use the body as an instrument to represent the swaying of grass in the wind as it does in nature.  This movement is meant to pay homage to the roll that grass plays in a warrior’s life.  It highlights the uses of grass to the warrior, whether it be for kindling for a fire or to create makeshift stockings to help keep warm (Vennum 77).  When this dance is performed, it is meant to ultimately show respect to those that came before, those that are here now, and those that will be, as well as to express gratitude to nature for its role in aiding the Anishinaabe life.</p>

		<h8><font size="+2">Pictorial Art</font></h8>
			<p>Another form of artistic expression taken used by Anishinaabe and other native tribes is the use of pictorial art.  I will discuss in length the meaning of the following examples I will present in this section.  Before arriving to the Cultural Meaning discussion section of this page, I urge the reader to view these works with a critical eye.  Think about what you see, and most importantly how your life’s experience has given you this idea about the picture.</p>

		<h9><font size="+2">Cultural Meaning and Discussion</font></h9>	
			<p>Art as a medium throughout time has been used to construct many things, such as identity, culture, symbolism, or simply just to be a beautiful depiction of somebody’s thought.  In this section I will use the art forms I presented previously to display the cultural meaning behind each and how it relates to the Anishinaabe way of life.  It is important to understand that the meaning carried through each of these media is unique to the community that performs it.  There are consistencies with the practice among the Anishinaabe tribes, however each tribe will tend to attribute a slightly different meaning to each practice.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Primarily, the drum being used in ceremony with singing carries an interesting set of ideas.  To start with the simplest form of usage, the maintenance of the drum is said to contribute to the definition of Anishinaabe masculinity (Vosen 98).  Stemming from this is an attitude of self-consciousness starting in new-coming performers.  They focus solely on their technique, or how they appear to other community members while they perform.  It isn’t until they grow older and become more seasoned performers when they lose this anxiety and perform to their full potential, thus realizing fully their place within their communities (Vosen 99).  All performers go through this maturation, and it is held in reverence throughout the Anishinaabe community.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Pictorial art in the Anishinaabe community is often a means of communicating human place, or role, within its natural context (Slivka 2016).  As a few of the images presented in the previous section, one can infer about how the Anishinaabe see human interaction with nature.  We use nature, we take care of it, we give thanks to it, we live in it, etc.  Because of nature’s role in the life of the Anishinaabe people, they express reverence for it in their art.  Another way that art is used in Anishinaabe life is to depict different aspects of their everyday life.  Aspects of Anishinaabe life can cover anything from political wrong-doings of their colonizers to something as small as first example above; picking blueberries.  In the form of artistic expression, the Anishinaabe people, among other native American communities, depict their life to outsiders, or to their own community if they so choose.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Potent meaning is also carried through in the form of dance.  In many native American communities like the Anishinaabe, dance expression often represents the structure of the society that performs the dance (Vennum 77).  As a tradition, the structure and meaning of a dance is carried down from generation to generation and is often times shared between different native American communities.  However, each tribe interprets and performs each dance differently.  The Grass Dance in the Anishinaabe community would be performed differently in a nearby community that shares their tradition.  The differences would depend on the community, itself.  Anything within the practice can be variable, from the actual structure of the dance to the officials partaking in the ceremonial gesture (Vennum 77).  Ultimately, dance is a dynamic way for the Anishinaabe to communicate their identity in that, like other art forms, it is branded unique to the community that practices with it.</p>
			
		<hr>
		<br>
		<h10><font size="+2">Conclusion</font></h10>
			<p>Artistic expression is a unique way that every culture on the planet can put their way of life on display for others to see.  It creates a space for certain aspects of life to be exaggerated and stand out.  Every small detail in artistic expression means something, and overall contributes to both what the artist wants to show as well as what the viewers see.  Dance, drum/song, and pictorial art are only three touched upon ideas that I have written about with the Anishinaabe community, among many others.  To communicate an identity is a practice that every human being has the ability to do, and thus does to the best of their ability.  There truly is no better way to show people what the artist wants others to see than through their artistic expression.  This allows those of us who would be viewers to better understand what the mindset of another can be, and ultimately allows us to grow closer as one human community.</p>
