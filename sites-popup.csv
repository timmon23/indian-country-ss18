Some of the most detrimental fires in recent years to federally recognized tribes includes the Spotted Eagle Fire (MT), Carpenter Road Fire (WA), Cougar Creek Fire (WA), and the North Star Fire (WA).","<a href='sites/wildfires-in-the-us-northwest/wildfires-in-the-us-northwest.html'> MORE DETAILS</a>"

The tourism industry completely contradicts and destroys its host culture while simultaneously bleeding the culture dry of its cultural values by turning their culture into a commodity. It demonstrates the moral injustice of consciously putting financial gain ahead of preserving and respecting its native host culture. Native Hawaiian communities live in political and cultural degradation with tourism industries encroaching on their ways of life.

This meaning that a large sect of the population served in the Alaskan rural school system are inadvertently categorized into a homogeneous group, in this case being American Indian or Alaskan Native. This means that policy that is enacted to help the schools are in large part policies that will have a real-time and generational effect on the American Indian and Alaskan Native populations.

This was distributed to all of their subsidiaries, including the stores Anthropologie and Free People. Some of the products that were under the 'Navajo' name were pairs of underwear labeled 'Navajo Hipster Panty' and a liquor flask. After all of the stereotypes connecting Native Americans with alcohol abuse, this turned into just one examples of the extreme distaste and ignorance that Urban Outfitters displayed. Without surprise, the Navajo Nation responded quickly to the appropriation, and filed a lawsuit against the company for using their name and displaying false information about Navajo culture. Unfortunately, these is a theme in big companies all throughout the Americas as well as the world, and definitely not a first offense for this company. Within my 'This is Indian Country' project I will be exploring further how the Navajo Indians respond to cultural appropriation, and give examples of the ways cultural appropriation is still a large and prominent part of today?s world.","<a href='sites/navajo-cul-appro-response/navajo-cul-appro-response.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"

The fashion industry especially is guilty of playing off of Hollywood generalizations of Indians adorned in buckskin and feathers.
